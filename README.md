# daily-planner

This assignment is a calander to assist students with keeping track of their daily activities. This project was broken down into a couple of parts, focusing on the HTML, and allocating all of the segments per hour. The next part was getting the JavaScript to reflect the color changes based off of hours. Finally, it was about saving and storing to the localStorage and intializing and pulling localStorage data and displaying it on screen. 

I seemed to have a lot of difficulties when it came to local storage, when pulling and pushing. I reflect on this code and realize how inefficient it is, and is definitely worth a refactor down the line. 

This project also had some difficulties in file management, as you may find some commits are spread apart across different files and different versions. I mainted the files within the "Develop" folder in order to track the commits made.
